| **Summary** | Expanded content or notes |

### Reordering Blocks

---

## Using Preach Mode

Preach Mode is a full-screen, distraction-free view designed for use during sermon delivery.

### Launching Preach Mode

From any sermon, click the **Preach Mode** button (screen icon).

### Navigation

**Touch/Click:**
- Tap the **left third** of the screen to go back
- Tap the **right third** of the screen to go forward
- The center area is safe for scrolling content

**Keyboard:**
- **Right Arrow** or **Space** - Next block
- **Left Arrow** - Previous block
- **F** - Toggle fullscreen
- **Escape** - Exit settings, fullscreen, or Preach Mode

**Buttons:**
- **Prev** / **Next** buttons in the header

### Timer & Target Time

1. Click the **gear icon** (Settings) in the header
2. Set your **Target Time** in minutes (e.g., 30)
3. The timer shows elapsed time as you preach

**Overtime Warning:**
When you exceed your target time:
- Timer background turns red
- Shows how many minutes/seconds you're over
- Non-intrusive (no popups or sounds)

### Fullscreen Mode

Click the **fullscreen icon** (or press **F**) to enter browser fullscreen. This:
- Hides browser chrome
- Maximizes screen space
- Reduces distractions

Press **Escape** or click the icon again to exit fullscreen.

### Block Display

Blocks are styled by type:
- **POINT**: Large, bold text with divider
- **SCRIPTURE**: Italic with book icon
- **ILLUSTRATION**: Medium text with lightbulb icon
- **NOTE**: Smaller, muted text

### Progress Indicator

The header shows your current position (e.g., "2 / 8") so you know how far through your outline you are.

### If You Have No Outline

If your sermon has no structured outline (no mainPoints), Preach Mode shows a "fallback" view with:
- Title and scripture
- Big idea (if set)
- Full manuscript (if entered)
- Application and call to action

---

## Printing Your Outline

Generate a clean, print-ready version of your sermon outline.

### Launching Print View

From any sermon, click the **Print Outline** button (printer icon).

### What's Included

The print view shows:
- Sermon title, date, preacher, scripture
- Big idea (highlighted)
- All blocks where "Print" toggle is ON
- Application section
- Call to action (highlighted)
- Extra notes

### Block Filtering

Only blocks with **Include in Print = Yes** appear in the print view.

**Tip:** Turn off "Print" for personal notes you don't want to share.

1. Click the **Print** button in the header
2. Your browser's print dialog opens

---

## Linking to Services

Connect your sermon to a bulletin or service for quick access.

### From the Bulletin/Service Items

1. Go to your bulletin and find the sermon service item
2. Click **Edit** on the service item
3. In the **Linked Sermon** field, select your sermon
4. Save the service item

### Quick Access Links

Once linked, the service item displays:
- **Sermon title** - Click to view full sermon details
- **Preach** button - Jump directly to Preach Mode
- **Print** button - Jump directly to Print view

This makes it easy to access your sermon tools right from the order of service.

## Tips for Effective Use

### Sermon Preparation

1. **Start with the Big Idea** - Enter this first to keep your sermon focused
2. **Use the 3-Point Template** - It's a proven structure; customize from there
3. **Add Scripture blocks** - Make passages you'll read aloud easy to find
4. **Use Notes for cues** - "Pause here" or "Make eye contact" reminders
5. **Set target time** - Helps you practice staying on track

### During Delivery

1. **Use fullscreen mode** - Minimizes distractions
2. **Navigate by touch** - Tap left/right sides for hands-free control
3. **Watch the timer** - Stay aware without being controlled by it
4. **Prepare fallback** - If tech fails, you still have your outline

### Sharing & Printing

1. **Hide personal notes** - Turn off "Print" for private reminders
2. **Print for small groups** - Great for discussion leaders
3. **Archive your work** - Sermons are saved and searchable

### Best Practices

| Do | Don't |
|-----|-------|
| Keep block labels concise | Write full paragraphs in labels |
| Use Notes for timing cues | Put transitions in main points |
| Test Preach Mode beforehand | First-time use during live sermon |
| Set realistic target time | Set time you can't achieve |
| Link to services in advance | Forget to link until Sunday morning |

## Troubleshooting
