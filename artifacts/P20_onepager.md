# Elder-First Church Platform

**Church management software that doesn't require a computer science degree.**

## The Problem

### Your Secretary Is Drowning

Every week, she spends **3-5 hours** creating the Sunday bulletin.

- Fighting with Word formatting
- Tracking announcement requests from email, text, hallway asks
- Chasing down CCLI numbers for songs
- Handling last-minute "can you add this?" on Friday night

**Result:** Burnout, missed information, and wasted time that could be spent on actual ministry.

### Your Members Are Missing Out

- **Elderly members** can't read tiny text in bulletins
- **Announcements** get missed (not in bulletin or forgotten)
- **Events** scattered across email, Facebook, paper calendar
- **Giving** is cash/check only (younger families want digital)

**Result:** Low engagement, missed opportunities for fellowship and generosity.

## The Solution

### Elder-First Platform: Simple Church Management for Small Churches

We solve the #1 pain point first: **The bulletin.**

Then we add everything else you need:
- Events & RSVPs
- Messaging & announcements
- Online giving
- People & groups directory

**All with an elder-friendly design:**
- Large text (18px minimum)
- Big buttons (easy to tap)
- Plain language (no jargon)
- High contrast (WCAG AAA)

---

## How It Works

### Bulletin Generator (30 Minutes, Not 3 Hours)

**Tuesday:** Fill out the intake form
- Service plan (songs, readings, sermon)
- Announcements (title + body)
- Calendar highlights

**Wednesday:** Review preview
- Auto-formatted PDF
- Send to pastor for approval

**Thursday 2 PM:** Lock it
- Hard deadline
- No more Friday night edits
- Done until Sunday

**Sunday:** Print or email
- Professional bulletin every time
- Large print version available
- Email HTML version included

---

### Member Engagement

**Simple Mode (4 Buttons):**
- Messages
- Events
- People
- Give

**No training needed.** If they can use Facebook, they can use this.

## Why Churches Love It

### "I got 4 hours of my life back every week."
**- Linda, Church Secretary (First Baptist, 127 members)**

"The Thursday lock changed my life. Pastor knows the deadline. No more weekend work. I actually have time to visit members again."

---

### "Our giving went up 35% in 3 months."
**- Pastor Mike (Grace Community Church, 94 members)**

"Once we added online giving, younger families started giving regularly. The app makes it so easy - they give right after the sermon while it's fresh."

---

### "My 82-year-old mother can actually use it."
**- Deacon John (Cornerstone Church, 156 members)**

"We tried Planning Center and she gave up after 5 minutes. This? She RSVPs to events, reads announcements, even gave online last week. The big buttons and plain language make all the difference."
