## "One Form or It Doesn't Happen" Policy

**Why This Matters:**

Too often, last-minute changes bypass the bulletin process. This creates:
- Confusion (announcement on screen but not in print)
- Wasted time (re-printing bulletins)
- Missed information (people don't know about events)

**The Rule:**

> **If it's not in the bulletin intake form by Thursday 2 PM, it doesn't go in the bulletin.**

**Exceptions:**
- **Emergency only:** Death in congregation, service cancellation due to weather
- **Emergency reopen:** Pastor can reopen locked bulletin, but a timestamp is added to every output showing it was changed after lock

**How to Enforce:**
1. **Communicate deadline** - "Bulletin announcements due Thursday 2 PM"
2. **Post deadline visibly** - On church calendar, in staff meetings
3. **Be firm** - If someone asks Friday, answer is "It will be in next week's bulletin"
4. **Empower admin** - Give bulletin coordinator authority to say no

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Consistent process
- ✅ Reduced stress
- ✅ Higher quality bulletins
- ✅ Fewer last-minute changes

### Issue: Kiosk Won't Print

**Symptoms:** Blank pages, error messages, or no print job starts

**Solutions:**
1. **Check basics:**
   - [ ] Is printer powered on?
   - [ ] Is it connected to network/computer?
   - [ ] Does it have paper?
   - [ ] Does it have toner/ink?

2. **Restart printer:**
   - [ ] Power off, wait 30 seconds, power on
   - [ ] Try printing test page from printer menu

3. **Check file:**
   - [ ] Can you open the PDF on computer?

   - [ ] Re-download PDF from platform

4. **Kiosk specific:**
   - [ ] Restart kiosk computer

### Issue: "CCLI Number Required" Error

**Symptoms:** Can't lock bulletin, error message says song missing CCLI

**Solution:**
1. **Identify the song:**
   - Error will show which song is missing CCLI number
   - Example: "Amazing Grace (position 2) requires CCLI number"

2. **Look up CCLI number:**
   - Go to SongSelect.com
   - Search for song title
   - Copy the CCLI number (e.g., 22025)

3. **Add to bulletin:**
   - Edit the service item
   - Paste CCLI number in "CCLI #" field
   - Save changes

4. **Try lock again:**
   - Click "Lock Bulletin"
   - Should succeed now

**Don't have SongSelect account?**
- Most hymns have CCLI numbers (Google "hymn name CCLI number")
- For original songs, leave CCLI blank and note in description
- Consider getting CCLI license (required for churches that project lyrics)

### Issue: "Image Too Large" Error

**Symptoms:** Upload fails with "File must be under 4MB"

**Solutions:**
1. **Check file size:**
   - Right-click image → Properties → Size
   - If over 4MB, needs compression

2. **Compress image:**
   - **Online tool:** TinyPNG.com or CompressJPEG.com
   - **On computer:**
     - Windows: Open in Paint → Resize → Save
     - Mac: Open in Preview → Tools → Adjust Size → Export

3. **Recommended settings:**
   - **Max width:** 1920px
   - **Format:** JPEG (not PNG for photos)
   - **Quality:** 80%
   - **Target size:** Under 2MB

4. **Aspect ratio:**
   - Platform expects 16:9 (landscape)
   - Will crop other ratios automatically
   - Use Canva or PowerPoint to create 1920x1080 canvas

**Still too large?**
- Take screenshot of image at smaller size
- Use Canva to resize before downloading

### Issue: Announcement Text Cut Off

**Symptoms:** Announcement doesn't fit, shows "..." ellipsis

**Cause:** Character limits
- Title: 60 characters max
- Body: 300 characters max

**Solutions:**
1. **Shorten text:**
   - Remove filler words ("very", "really", "just")
   - Use contractions ("don't" instead of "do not")
   - Use abbreviations ("Wed" instead of "Wednesday")

2. **Split announcement:**
   - If too much info, make it two announcements
   - Or link to full details on website

3. **Use full bulletin section:**
   - Top 3 announcements get full display
   - Remaining show as compact list
   - Prioritize most important

**Character counter:**
- Platform shows character count as you type
- Green = OK, Yellow = Warning, Red = Too long

**Example:**

❌ **Too long (72 chars):**
> "Join us for our annual church-wide potluck dinner this coming Sunday evening"

✅ **Good (58 chars):**
> "Church potluck this Sunday at 6 PM. Bring a dish to share!"
