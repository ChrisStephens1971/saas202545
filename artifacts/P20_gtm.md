**Product:** Elder-First Church Platform
**Target Launch:** Q1 2026
**Initial Market:** Small churches (50-200 members)

---

## Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)

### Church Profile

**Size:** 50-200 members (sweet spot: 75-150)

**Characteristics:**
- Traditional/evangelical denomination (Baptist, Presbyterian, Methodist, Non-denominational)
- Single location (not multi-site)
- Located in suburban or rural areas
- Budget: $50,000-$200,000/year
- Tech-savvy: Low to medium (using email, maybe Facebook)
- Existing tools: Microsoft Word for bulletins, Google Calendar, email lists

**Decision Makers:**
- Pastor (final say, budget approval)
- Church secretary/administrator (day-to-day user, main pain point)
- Elder board (approves spending >$500)

### Pain Points

**Primary (Secretary/Admin):**
1. **Drowning in bulletin chaos**
   - Creates bulletin from scratch every week in Word
   - Last-minute changes from pastor Friday afternoon
   - Typos slip through, formatting breaks
   - Takes 3-5 hours per week

2. **Announcement overload**
   - 15+ requests per week, hard to track
   - Email, text, phone calls, after-service hallway asks
   - No central place to collect them
   - Feels like a gatekeeper (saying no is hard)

3. **Event coordination nightmare**
   - Events in multiple places (paper calendar, Google Cal, emails)
   - RSVPs via text, email, phone - no single list
   - Can't easily see who's coming

4. **Time stress**
   - Works 10-15 hours/week (part-time)
   - Unpaid overtime every week
   - Burnout risk high

**Secondary (Pastor):**
- Wants better engagement tracking (who's reading announcements?)
- Wishes bulletin looked more professional
- Frustrated by last-minute "can you add this?" culture

**Tertiary (Members):**
- Elderly members struggle with small print in bulletin
- Miss announcements (not in bulletin or forgot)
- Don't know how to RSVP to events

### Jobs To Be Done

When I use [Elder-First Platform], I want to:
1. **Reduce bulletin creation time** from 3-5 hours to 30 minutes
2. **Eliminate last-minute chaos** with hard Thursday lock deadline
3. **Centralize announcement collection** in one intake form
4. **Produce professional-looking bulletins** without design skills
5. **Track event RSVPs** in one place
6. **Make content accessible** to elderly members (large text, high contrast)

---

## Value Proposition

**For church secretaries drowning in bulletin and announcement chaos:**

> Reclaim 4 hours every week. Create professional bulletins in 30 minutes with one simple form. Lock it Thursday, print it Sunday. No more Friday afternoon panic.

**For pastors who want to grow their church:**

> Engage your members with a modern platform they'll actually use. Large buttons, plain language, made for the 65+ crowd. Bulletin, giving, events, and messages in one place.

## Positioning

**Category:** Church Management Software (sub-category: Bulletin & Engagement)

**Competitors:**
- Planning Center Online ($199/month, complex, overkill for small churches)
- Church Community Builder ($149/month, ugly UI, not elder-friendly)

**Our Differentiation:**
1. **Elder-first design** - Actually built for 65+ users
2. **Bulletin-centric** - Solves #1 pain point first
3. **Simple pricing** - One flat fee, no modules to add
4. **Concierge onboarding** - We build first bulletin with you
5. **No contract** - Cancel anytime, export data

**Positioning Statement:**

> For small churches (50-200 members) whose secretary is drowning in bulletin and announcement chaos, Elder-First Platform is the church management software that reduces bulletin creation from 3 hours to 30 minutes with one simple form and a Thursday lock deadline. Unlike Planning Center or CCB which are complex and expensive, we focus on elder-friendly design and the tasks that actually cause pain every week.

## Risk Mitigation

**Risk:** Market too small (not enough small churches)
**Mitigation:** 180,000 churches in US under 200 members. 1% penetration = 1,800 customers = $1.7M ARR

**Risk:** Competitors (Planning Center) lower price
**Mitigation:** Focus on elder-first UX and bulletin-first approach. They can't easily copy simplicity.

**Risk:** Churches don't want to change
**Mitigation:** 30-day trial with concierge onboarding. Make switching painless.

**Risk:** Low trial-to-paid conversion
**Mitigation:** Onboarding call to get first win fast (first bulletin created). Weekly check-ins during trial.

**Risk:** High churn
**Mitigation:** Customer success team checks in quarterly. Annual discount (17% off) to lock in.
