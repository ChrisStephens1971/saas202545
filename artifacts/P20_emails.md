## Email Sequence (3 Emails + 1 Call)

### Email #1: The Pain Point (Day 1)

**Subject:** Spending 3+ hours on the Sunday bulletin?

**From:** Sarah @ Elder-First Platform

**Body:**

Hi [First Name],

Quick question: How long does it take you to create your church bulletin every week?

If you're like most church secretaries I talk to, it's probably 3-5 hours.

And that's if nothing changes. (Friday afternoon edits, anyone?)

I built a tool that cuts that down to 30 minutes with one simple form.

No design skills needed. No Word formatting battles. No last-minute chaos.

**Here's how it works:**
1. Tuesday: Fill out the intake form (service plan + announcements)
2. Wednesday: Review preview, send to pastor
3. Thursday 2 PM: Lock it. Done.
4. Sunday: Print or email. Perfect bulletin every time.

Want to try it? I'll even build your first bulletin with you on a free call.

Or just reply and tell me I'm crazy. 😊

P.S. The "Thursday lock" is life-changing. No more "can you add this?" on Friday night.

### Email #2: Social Proof (Day 4)

**Subject:** "I got 4 hours of my life back" - Church secretary

**From:** Sarah @ Elder-First Platform

**Body:**

Hi [First Name],

Last week I sent you an email about reducing bulletin creation time.

I wanted to share what one of our beta testers said:

> "I used to spend all Friday afternoon on the bulletin. Now I'm done by Thursday lunch. I actually have time to visit members again."
>
> - Linda, First Baptist Church (127 members)

Linda's been using Elder-First Platform for 6 weeks. Here's what she loves:

✅ **One form for everything** - No more tracking announcement requests in 5 different places
✅ **Thursday lock** - Pastor knows the deadline, no more Friday changes
✅ **Auto-format** - Looks professional without design work
✅ **CCLI built-in** - Won't let you lock without song numbers

Her bulletin used to take 4 hours. Now it's 30-45 minutes.

That's 3+ hours back every single week.

**Want the same result?**

I'll show you exactly how it works. If it's not a fit, no worries.

Sarah

P.S. We also do events, giving, and messaging. But honestly, the bulletin generator alone is worth it.

### Email #3: The Offer (Day 8)

**Subject:** Last call: Free bulletin setup (this week only)

**From:** Sarah @ Elder-First Platform

**Body:**

Hi [First Name],

I've reached out a couple times about Elder-First Platform - the tool that reduces bulletin creation from 3 hours to 30 minutes.

This is my last email (promise!), but I wanted to make you an offer:

**This week only: I'll personally build your first bulletin with you.**

Here's what that looks like:
- 30-minute Zoom call
- You give me your service plan + announcements
- I walk you through entering them in the platform
- We build your bulletin together in real-time
- You download the PDF ready to print

No charge. No credit card needed.

If you love it, you can keep using it ($79/month or $790/year).

If not, you've got a free bulletin and learned a few tricks. Win-win.

**Only 5 spots available this week.** After that, I'm booked.

Or if bulletins aren't your pain point, just hit reply and let me know - I won't bug you again.

Sarah

P.S. Seriously, the Thursday lock changed our secretary's life. No more weekend work.

## Follow-Up Call Script

**Day 12 (If no email response)**

### Call Script

**Opening:**
> "Hi, this is Sarah from Elder-First Platform. Is this a good time for a quick call?
> [Wait for response]
> Great! I sent you a few emails about reducing bulletin creation time, but I know email gets buried. Thought I'd try calling."

**Qualifying Question:**
> "Quick question: About how long does it take you to create your Sunday bulletin each week?"

**If 3+ hours:**
> "Okay, so you definitely feel the pain! The reason I'm calling is because we built a tool specifically for small churches like yours that cuts that down to about 30 minutes. It's one simple form - you enter your service plan and announcements, and it formats everything into a professional PDF. Would it be helpful if I showed you how it works real quick?"

**If <2 hours or "not my job":**
> "Oh, you've got a good system! That's great. Let me ask - who handles your bulletin? Would it make sense for me to talk to them instead?"

**Demo Booking:**
> "Perfect. I can do a 15-minute screenshare and show you exactly how it works. I've got [Day/Time] or [Day/Time] open. Which works better?"

**Objection Handling:**

**"We're happy with Word"**
> "I totally get it! Most churches are. The question is just whether you're spending 3-4 hours on it when you could spend 30 minutes and use that time for actual ministry. But if Word is working, no pressure."

**"We don't have budget"**
> "Totally understand. Just so you know, it's $79/month which is about what you'd pay for coffee for your team. And we have a free trial so you can see if it saves you time before paying anything. But I get budget is tight."

**"We need to think about it"**
> "Of course! What would be helpful - would a 15-minute demo give you what you need to make a decision? Or is there something specific you're unsure about?"

**Closing:**
> "Perfect, I'll send you a calendar link. And hey, if it's not a fit after the demo, totally fine. At least you'll see what's possible. Sound good?"

### Post #1: Pain + Solution

**Post:**

Anyone else spend 3+ hours every week on the Sunday bulletin? 🙋‍♀️

I'm a church secretary at a 110-member church, and I was drowning. Word formatting, last-minute changes Friday afternoon, typos slipping through...

So I worked with a developer to build a tool that cuts it down to 30 minutes.

**How it works:**
- One simple form (service plan + announcements)
- Auto-formats into professional PDF
- Locks on Thursday at 2 PM (no more Friday changes!)
- Includes CCLI validation so you don't forget song numbers

We just launched a free trial. No credit card, no pressure. I'll even build your first bulletin with you on a free call.

Drop a comment or DM if you want the link. Happy to help!

### Post #2: Case Study

**Post:**

Update: We've had 23 churches try our bulletin tool in the last 2 weeks!

The average time saved: **3.2 hours per week**.

That's 166 hours per year. Almost a full month of work days.

One secretary told me: "I got my Fridays back. I actually leave at 3 PM now instead of 6."

If you're spending hours every week fighting with Word, formatting, and last-minute changes - there's a better way.

(P.S. I also built a tool that auto-formats this for you, but this template is free and works great in Word too.)

## Pastor Forum Posts

### Reddit r/pastors

**Post Title:** Tool to reduce bulletin creation time? (seeking feedback)

**Body:**

Hey pastors,

Our church secretary spends about 4 hours every week on the bulletin. Lots of Word formatting, tracking announcement requests, chasing down CCLI numbers, last-minute edits...

I'm considering a tool that automates most of this. Has anyone used church management software specifically for bulletin generation?

Looking at:
- Planning Center (seems overkill/expensive for us - 90 members)
- Church Community Builder (UI looks dated)
- A new tool called Elder-First Platform (bulletin-focused, simpler)

Would love to hear experiences. What works for small churches?

Thanks!

### 9Marks Forum

**Post Title:** Helping our secretary with bulletin overload

**Body:**

Brothers,

Our faithful church secretary is burning out. She's part-time (15 hours/week) but works closer to 25 because the bulletin and announcements take so much time.

I feel convicted we're not stewarding her time well.

Has anyone solved this problem? Looking for:
1. Better process (we currently use Word)
2. Tools that help (without being overkill for a small church)
3. Policies (like an announcement deadline)

Any wisdom appreciated.

In Christ,
[Name]
